# Astro5560
This is my Astro 5560 final project on the two-point correlation functions of quasars and massive galaxies in the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG (TNG300 volume) and ASTRID. Interactive_corr_plot.ipynb creates an interactive figure showing the results, using the Corr_combos_data.npz data file. Save_param_combos.ipynb shows how this data file was created, using publicly accessible simulation data from the [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/data/) and [ASTRID](https://astrid.psc.edu/data-access/) websites. corr_combos_fig.py and requirements.txt create a [Streamlit version](https://emmajaneweller-astro5560-corr-combos-fig-1ie7wk.streamlit.app/) of the interactive figure.
